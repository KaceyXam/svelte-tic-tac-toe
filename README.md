# Svelte Tic Tac Toe

This is a very simple version of Tic Tac Toe that I made with svelte. The Goal of this project was simply to come up with an Idea for a simple project and see it to the end.

I decided to use Svelte because, from my experience, Svelte is easier to get working compared to React.
